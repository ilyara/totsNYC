SD TRANSACTION SETUP


Tenant finds a lease he wants
Tenant decides to use SD and gets Landlord to agree
Tenant goes online and sets up a new account or a new SD transaction for an existing account
Tenant enters Lanlord’s email address, SD amount, and account funding info (separate steps)


Tenant accepts terms and agrees to fees and dispute resolution procedures
Landlord gets an email prompting to set up new SD account or enter into a new SD transaction
Landlord accepts SD transaction amount, accepts terms and agrees to dispute resolution procedures
SD initiates transfer of funds with Bank into an Escrow Account / sub-account
SD receives successful transfer confirmation from Bank
SD Notifies Tenant and Landlord that SD funds are locked in

SD TRANSACTION UNWIND
Either Tenant or Landlord can initiate SD Unwind process (“SD Refund”)
Tenant request a full or partial SD Refund
Landlord is notified via email  or his preferred contact method (sms, automated call)
Landlord agrees to a full or partial SD Refund amount or requests to withhold an amount for damages
All Tenant-Landlord communication, interim negotiated amounts, and supporting photos / docs are logged
If an agreement is reached within specified time frame, SD releases the funds as agreed by Tenant and Landlord
If no agreement is reached - or if external mediation is requested by either party (for all or part of SD amount) - SD awaits the results (the judgement), verifies and records resulting paperwork, notifies the parties, and distributes the funds accordingly
